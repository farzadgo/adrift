## adrift app

The public repository for adrift app, part of my work associated with Digital Media Bremen master program.

Adrift deconstructs Google Maps direction text* and by doing so it offers a new set of directions based on the original one, thus it enables the performers to get lost in their very own urban fabric. "Getting lost" refers the perception of the environment that we live in, in a different way than we experience in our everyday lives. During the walk to nowhere (or run, play, etc.), the performers are being asked a set of questions regarding the surrounding environment, hoping to initiate another level of observation and meaning making. The recorde


A similar approach to walking and moving in the city was initiated and performed by the **Situationis International** organization members frequently in 1960s Paris, calling it the act of **d√©rive** or ("drift").


During each step of the drift (walking, running, playing etc.) the app asks a question regarding the surrounding 
and offers the opportunaty to record the answers in form of conversations between the drifters. The recorded conversations and sounds are  

Adrift celebrated the journey

*The mentioned Google Maps direction text (generated by the Maps directions API) is accesible by sharing the selected walking direction to the searched location on Maps mobile app (See the instructions).

## Development Storage and data privacy
Adrift is a front-end single page application (SPA) written in vanilla Javascript. I uses te


The page data storage is currently sessionStorage, which means after page reload the data will be cleaned.
Another simple method of saving data including media files, here voice recordings (blobs) is to use cloud services such as Firebase, AWS, Azure etc. yet regarding data privacy issues it is prefered to use client-side storage (on the machine / browser). Unlike sessionStorage, localStorage can rather keep simple data (here directions, steps, orders) for later visit of the page whick can be implemented in later versions.
