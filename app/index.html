              Adrift deconstructs Google Maps direction text** and by doing so it offers a new set of directions based on the original one, thus it enables the performers to get lost in their very own environment. "Getting lost" refers to the perception of the urban fabric in a different way than what we usually experience in <b>everyday life</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              During the walk (or run, play, etc.) to nowhere, the performers are being asked a set of questions regarding the surrounding and offered the opportunity to record the answers in the form of conversations between them, hoping to initiate another level of observation and meaning-making through the act of walking and mapping.

            <p class="content-text quote">
              "VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries."

            <p class="content-text">
              Adrift uses modern web API such as MediaStream Recording API, which is currently <b>not supported by iOS devices</b>.

            <p class="content-text">
              A common practice in saving user data (including media files) is to use cloud services, yet regarding the <b>data privacy</b> issues this version of Adrift does not provide any data storage. This means that after the page reload the data will be cleaned. However, it is possible to save the drifts/memories/recordings by tapping on specified download buttons.

              The "drift" and so the app are related to the concepts of "Psychogeography" and  and "Dérive".

            <p class="content-text quote">
              <b>Psychogeography</b> is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting". It has links to the Letterist and <b>Situationist International</b>s, revolutionary groups influenced by Marxist and anarchist theory, as well as by the attitudes and methods of Dadaists and Surrealists.[1] Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by Guy Debord as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."[2]
            </p>
            <p class="content-text quote">
              <b>Dérive</b> (French: [de.ʁiv], "drift") is a revolutionary strategy originally put forward in the "Theory of the Dérive" (1956) by Guy Debord.[1] Debord defines the dérive as "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances."[2] It is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, in which participants drop their everyday relations and "let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there". Though solo dérives are possible, Debord indicates "that the most fruitful numerical arrangement consists of several small groups of two or three people who have reached the same level of awareness, since cross-checking these different groups' impressions makes it possible to arrive at more objective conclusions."[3]
